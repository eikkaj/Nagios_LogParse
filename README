@2012 Jackie Aldama

This is a quick attempt at building my knowledge of Perl and parsing a Nagios logfile. There is a lot of work to be done and things to consider to be able to move this into production. This code was written as an intern in the Spring/Summer of 2012 but the project was put on hold as the office use of Nagios couldn't provide reliable data to be able to parse the logfiles easily. 

Questions that came up:
-Determining the uptime percentage:
	1.Uptime per month? 
	2.As a correlation between number of active services/hosts, time period, total down time of
	those hosts/services
	3.Does Nagios have a host for every service, if so, we should only be looking at one or the
	other?
##At this moment the code just sums up the total time so far in the current month and compares that with the total amount of 'downtime'

-What about if more than one service goes down at the same time, or their down time coincides with another service's downtime?
-Maintenance Windows?
-Publicly visible downtimes vs Internal doesn't-matter-as-much-stuff

Output is an html template. Interested in experimenting with other graphing technologies.
